1. Introduction Phase
HR: Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. Could you start by introducing yourself?
C: Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity. My name is Sara Haddad. I recently graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, where I developed strong foundations in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and machine design. I also completed a capstone project involving the design and simulation of a compact heat exchanger. I’m particularly interested in design-oriented roles where I can combine analysis, CAD modeling, and problem-solving.
HR: Great. What motivated you to pursue mechanical engineering?
C: I’ve always been interested in understanding how machines work and how systems can be optimized. Mechanical engineering offered a broad discipline covering design, energy systems, and manufacturing, which matched my curiosity and career goals.

2. Motivation & Company Fit
HR: What attracted you to this position?
C: The role emphasizes product design and performance improvement, which aligns with my academic projects and internship experience. I also appreciate your company’s focus on innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration.
HR: What would you say are your main strengths?
C: My main strengths are analytical thinking, CAD proficiency, and persistence in problem-solving. I also work well in teams and communicate technical concepts clearly.
HR: And a weakness?
C: Early in my studies, I focused heavily on theoretical work. I’ve been actively improving my hands-on skills through lab work, simulations, and small personal projects.

3. Fundamental Technical Assessment
TE: Let’s move to some technical questions. Can you explain the difference between stress and strain?
C: Stress is the internal force per unit area within a material caused by an external load, typically measured in Pascals. Strain represents the deformation relative to the original dimension and is dimensionless.
TE: Good. What is Reynolds number and why is it important?
C: Reynolds number is a dimensionless parameter used to predict flow regime behavior by comparing inertial and viscous forces. It helps determine whether flow is laminar, transitional, or turbulent.
TE: Can you list the main heat transfer modes?
C: Conduction, convection, and radiation.
TE: What is factor of safety?
C: It is the ratio between material strength and the expected working stress, providing a margin against failure due to uncertainties.

4. Design & Engineering Practice
TE: Tell me about your experience with CAD tools.
C: I primarily use SolidWorks for 3D modeling and assemblies. I’ve created parametric parts, conducted interference checks, and generated technical drawings for manufacturing.
TE: Walk me through your design process.
C: I begin with requirement analysis, followed by concept generation and selection. Then I perform preliminary calculations, create CAD models, run simulations if necessary, refine the design for manufacturability, and finalize documentation.
TE: How do you select materials?
C: I consider mechanical properties, operating environment, cost, manufacturability, weight, and availability. I also use material selection charts and standards when appropriate.

5. Project Discussion
TE: Tell us about a project you are proud of.
C: My final-year project involved designing a compact shell-and-tube heat exchanger for small industrial applications. I was responsible for thermal calculations, CAD modeling, and CFD simulation.
TE: What challenges did you encounter?
C: Balancing heat transfer efficiency with pressure drop constraints was challenging. I iterated the design and adjusted tube arrangement to optimize both parameters.
TE: What would you improve if you repeated the project?
C: I would incorporate experimental validation to compare simulation and real performance.

6. Problem-Solving Scenario
TE: Suppose a rotating shaft experiences excessive vibration. How would you approach this?
C: I would first identify vibration sources such as imbalance, misalignment, or resonance. Then I would conduct measurements, check balancing, inspect bearings, verify alignment, and evaluate operating speed relative to natural frequencies.
TE: A component fails prematurely. What steps do you take?
C: I would perform root cause analysis including load verification, material inspection, fracture analysis, environmental factors review, and comparison with design assumptions.

7. Manufacturing Knowledge
TE: Difference between casting and forging?
C: Casting involves pouring molten material into molds, offering complex geometry capability. Forging uses compressive forces on solid material, improving mechanical properties and grain structure.
TE: What is CNC machining?
C: Computer-controlled machining process enabling precise and repeatable manufacturing operations such as milling and turning.
TE: Are you familiar with preventive maintenance?
C: Yes, it involves scheduled inspections and servicing to prevent unexpected failures and extend equipment life.

8. Behavioral Assessment
HR: Tell me about a time you had conflict in a team.
C: During a project, we disagreed on design direction. I suggested evaluating both approaches using objective criteria and simulation results, which helped us reach consensus.
HR: How do you manage deadlines?
C: I break tasks into milestones, prioritize critical activities, and track progress using simple planning tools.
HR: How do you handle feedback?
C: I view feedback as an opportunity for improvement and actively apply suggestions to enhance my work.

9. Closing Phase
HR: Why should we hire you?
C: I bring solid fundamentals, practical design exposure, strong motivation to learn, and a collaborative mindset that would allow me to contribute effectively while growing in the role.
HR: Where do you see yourself in five years?
C: I aim to become a competent mechanical engineer capable of leading design initiatives and mentoring junior engineers.
HR: Do you have any questions for us?
C: Yes, could you describe the typical onboarding process and the main projects this role will support?
HR: Certainly — we’ll explain that next. Thank you for your time today.
C: Thank you for the opportunity.
